# Calculator
This is a small calculator created using one function and id of a button @KqT

Instead of creating a function for all button, i get an idea of getId() of all the button 
then i put the Id of the button in a switch loop and the operation which have to be done by those button

But i make a Toast.makeText of all button Id in other to know they id and put them in the switch loop
